This is an R Markdown document about Chapter 8 of [this book](https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/book/detail/9784798143446).

## Evaluation indicator in association analysis

This is a [great reference](https://www.albert2005.co.jp/knowledge/marketing/customer_product_analysis/abc_association).

### Support

The ratio of transaction including product X and Y to all transactions.

![support](./supp.jpg)

 
### Confidence

The ratio of transaction including product X and Y to transaction of X. 

![conficence](./conf.jpg)

This indicator decides the direction of recommendation. 

For example, if X is printer and Y is ink cartridge,

X -> Y : reasonable recommendation

Y -> X : questionable recommendation


### Lift

The ratio of confidence to the ratio of transaction of Y to all transactions. More than 1 is considered a good recommendation rule.

## 8.3 Try arules package

```{r install package, include=FALSE}
install.packages("arules", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(arules)
```

```{r install dataset, include=FALSE}
data(Groceries)
#if you want to read an original file you prepare,
#Groceries <- read.transaction("Groceries.txt", format="basket", sep=",")

str(Groceries)
```

### summary statistics
```{r check dataset in first 6 rows}
inspect(head(Groceries))
```

```{r summary statistics}
summary(Groceries)

```

```{r histogram}
itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, support=0.04, cex.names=0.8)# support: set threshold of support, cex.names = adjust the size of labels
```

### apriori function
```{r apriori}
rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.005, confidence = 0.01)) # we can set thresholds
```

If we want to get associated transactions of beef, we can find products often bought with beef by sorting the data by `lift`.
```{r beef}
beefRules <- subset(rules,subset= rhs %in% "beef")
inspect(head(sort(beefRules,by= "lift")))

```
However, based on support, the 3rd combination--{root veg} -> {beef}-- might be more insightful.


```{r save csv file}
write(beefRules, file="data.csv", sep=",", col.names=NA)
```
