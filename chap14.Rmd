## 14.2 Algorithums

### Three Types of Algorithums

| Category  | Overview | Methods |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Memory-based | Based on the similarities between users/items | User-based, Item-based |
| Model-based | Based on classification models with learning data, identify the patterns of purchase activities | Bayesian Network, Clustering, and Regression models |
| Hybrid    | Between Memory-based and Model-based | - |


## 14.4 Recommenderlab

### Datatype

- realRatingMatrix: Numeric and non-binary rating
- binaryRatingMatrix: binary rating (0 or 1)

```{r install packages, include=F}
install.packages("recommenderlab", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(recommenderlab)
```


```{r install data}
data("MovieLense")
MovieLense
```


```{r }
# convert into dataframe
head(as(MovieLense, "data.frame"))

# convert into matrix
as(MovieLense, "matrix")[501:505, 1:5]
```

### Visualize rating

```{r}
image(MovieLense, main="Raw Ratings")
```

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
# Number of Rating by user
rowCounts(MovieLense)
summary(rowCounts(MovieLense))

# Ave. Rating Score by user
rowMeans(MovieLense)
summary(rowMeans(MovieLense))
hist(rowMeans(MovieLense))
```

We could say that there are biases among the users. Some tend to rate higher than others do. It is common to normalize the data in advance using `recommenderlab::normalize`
- center: Subtract the average rate of the user from non-NA rate
- Z-score: Divide the result of the above center by the standard deviation of the user

```{r}
rowMeans(normalize(MovieLense, method = "center"))
summary(rowMeans(normalize(MovieLense, method = "center")))
```

### Apply Algorithms

Algorithms in `recommenderlab``

| Algorithm  | Overview | realRatingMatrix | binaryRatingMatrix |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| RANDOM | Choose items at random and recommend them | Yes | Yes |
| POPULAR| Recommend popular items based on the number of buyers | Yes | Yes |
| UBCF | User-Based Collaborative Filtering | Yes | Yes |
| IBCF | Item-Based Collaborative Filtering | Yes | Yes |
| PCA  | Principal Component Analysis | Yes | No |
| SVD  | Singular Value Decomposition (for demention reduction) | Yes | No |
| AR   | Recommend items based on association rule | No | Yes |


```{r}
# summary 
# recommenderRegistry$get_entries(dataType='realRatingMatrix')
# recommenderRegistry$get_entries(dataType='binaryRatingMatrix')
```


## Create Recommender

Let's do UBCF (User-Based Collaborative Filtering).
1. Create recommender based on trainging data
2. Predict recommendation: Create Top-N list and predict rading

### 1. Create Recommender

Use `Recommender`function. the 1st arg is training data of rating matrix and 2nd arg is method.

```{r}
# with the first 500 data
r <- Recommender(MovieLense[1:500], method ="UBCF")

```

### 2. Predict Recommendation

Use `predict` function. Do recommendation.

```{r}
# predict rating of #501-505 users
p <- predict(r, MovieLense[501:505], type = "ratings")

# display the predicted ratings of the first 5 movies
as(p, "matrix")[1:5,1:5]

```


For the movies the users already rated, **NA** is shown.


## Evaluate the algorithms

With RMSE, evaluate the algorithms
1. Create the evaluation criteria
2. Evaluate

### 1. Create the evaluation criteria

```{r}
# Split method
e <- evaluationScheme(MovieLense, method = "split", train = 0.9, given = 15)

# set 90% of data as training and 10% as test
# 15 items in the test data for prediction and the other for prediction error calculation

```

### 2. Evaluate

```{r}
# UBCF recommender with training data
r.ubcf <- Recommender(getData(e, "train"), method = "UBCF")
# IBCF recommender with training data
r.ibcf <- Recommender(getData(e, "train"), method = "IBCF")

# Predict with test data and UBCF recommender
p.ubcf <- predict(r.ubcf, getData(e, "known"), type = "ratings")
# Predict with test data and IBCF recommender
p.ibcf <- predict(r.ibcf, getData(e, "known"), type = "ratings")
```

Calculate accuracies of UBCF and IBCF

```{r}
e <- rbind(calcPredictionAccuracy(p.ubcf, getData(e,"unknown")),
           calcPredictionAccuracy(p.ibcf, getData(e,"unknown")))
rownames(e) <- c("UBCF","IBCF")
e
```

IBCF has higher accuracy.

```{r}
help(package="recommenderlab")
```
